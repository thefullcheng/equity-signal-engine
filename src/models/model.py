"""Walk-forward LightGBM model for cross-sectional return prediction.

Training uses an expanding window re-fit once per calendar year. Hyperparameters
are fixed (no tuning loop) to keep the walk-forward evaluation honest — the
biggest silent risk in rolling-window backtests is leaking test-set information
through hyperparameter search.

Dev mode: restricts each date's universe to the top-N tickers by dollar_vol_60,
enabling fast iteration without changing the model or backtest logic.
