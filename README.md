Strategy: long top-20% by model score, 20-day rebalance, no market-timing
overlay, 10 bps per-side transaction costs. **No short leg** — the long-short
design was the original intent (isolating the cross-sectional signal by
canceling market beta), but shorting costs and hard-to-borrow constraints on
smaller/delisted names aren't modeled in this backtest's data, so long-only is
the more realistic framing given that limitation, at the cost of not cleanly
separating stock-selection skill from market beta. See **Decomposition**
below for how much of the return is attributable to each.

## Decomposition: how much is the model actually contributing?

A long-only, trend-filtered strategy's Sharpe conflates three things: equity
beta over a strong bull period, any market-timing overlay, and the
cross-sectional model. This breaks it apart:

| Configuration | Sharpe | Ann. return | Vol | Max DD | CAGR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (a) Equal-weight buy-and-hold, no regime, no model | 0.570 | 9.83% | 17.25% | -37.8% | 8.60% |
| (b) Equal-weight + 200d regime filter, no model | 0.472 | 5.35% | 11.33% | -22.5% | 4.80% |
| **(c) Model portfolio, no regime filter (current default)** | **0.665** | **10.97%** | 16.50% | -31.4% | **10.00%** |
| (d) Model + 200d regime filter | 0.471 | 5.41% | 11.50% | -25.3% | 4.84% |

Two things this shows plainly:

1. **The regime filter hurts, in both cases it's applied** — (a)→(b) and
   (c)→(d) both lose Sharpe. It was originally intended as a risk-reducing
   market-timing overlay; once built on a correct equal-weight *return* index
   (see below), it doesn't earn its keep. It's not used by default.
2. **The model beats passive buy-and-hold on this specific historical sample**
   — (c) beats (a) by both Sharpe and absolute return. Whether that's a real,
   generalizable edge or a good draw from noise is a separate question — see
   **Statistical significance** below, where the honest answer is "not
   confidently distinguishable from luck."

**A bug this decomposition surfaced**: the original regime filter averaged
raw *price levels* across the universe (`prices.mean(axis=1)`) rather than
compounding daily *returns* — a price-weighted index, not equal-weighted (a
$500 stock moved it 100x more than a $5 stock for the same % move). Fixed in
`equal_weight_index()` (`src/backtest/backtest.py`). Once fixed, the
200-day window — which happened to sit at the top of its own sensitivity
sweep under the old (buggy) index — no longer looks favorable at any window;
see **Sensitivity summary**.

## Statistical significance: is this distinguishable from luck?

**Momentum-only baseline.** A naive 12-1 month momentum sort (no model, no
fundamentals, no LightGBM) over the identical 169 periods:

| | IC t-stat | Sharpe | CAGR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Momentum-only (single feature) | 0.62 | 0.653 | 9.6% |
| Full model (5 features + LightGBM) | 0.48 | 0.665 | 10.0% |

The entire pipeline — EDGAR fundamentals, feature engineering, walk-forward
LightGBM — earns essentially a rounding error over sorting by trailing
12-month return alone, and has *lower* IC doing it. This is the honest
complexity-vs-payoff comparison an interviewer would run in their head.

**Permutation null test.** Shuffled which ticker gets which predicted score
within each rebalance date (destroying any real score↔outcome relationship
while preserving the cross-sectional and time-series structure), recomputed
IC, repeated 2,000 times to build a null distribution:

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Observed IC mean | +0.0050 |
| Null distribution mean | +0.0001 (centered at ~0, as expected) |
| Null distribution std | 0.0036 |
| **Empirical p-value** (P(null IC ≥ observed)) | **0.089** |
| Observed IC's percentile in the null | 91st |

**This does not clear conventional significance (p < 0.05).** The observed
IC is directionally positive and beats ~91% of random permutations, but a
p-value of 0.089 means we can't confidently rule out that this is a good
draw from noise rather than genuine, generalizable predictive skill. Combined
with the momentum-only comparison above, the fair summary of this whole
project is: **rigorous, correctly-built infrastructure (point-in-time
universe, walk-forward validation, EDGAR integration) surfacing a weak signal
that is suggestive but not statistically confirmed** — not a validated
trading edge.

## Feature set (5 features, all rank-normalised cross-sectionally)

Started at 8; `mom_3`, `mom_1`, `rsi_14` were excluded from training from the
start (negative individual IC). `mom_6_1`, `high_52w`, `vol_21` were later
dropped after measuring ~zero individual IC — see **Known Limitations** for
why that specific decision has a methodology caveat of its own.

| Feature | Type | IC | t-stat |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mom_12_1` | Price — 12-1 month momentum | +0.012 | 0.85 |
| `dollar_vol_60` | Price — 60-day avg dollar volume | +0.006 | 0.85 |
| `gross_prof` | Fundamental — gross profit / assets (Novy-Marx) | +0.002 | 0.21 |
| `roe` | Fundamental — net income / equity | +0.011 | 1.34 |
| `ep_ratio` | Fundamental — earnings / market cap | -0.004 | -0.44 |

None of these individually clears a conventional significance bar, and with
5+ features tested, `roe`'s t=1.34 shouldn't be read as a standout finding —
it's what you'd expect to see somewhere in this set by chance alone. The
model's IC (t=0.48, combining all features nonlinearly via LightGBM) is the
number that actually matters, and it's modest.

## Sensitivity summary

| Dimension | Sharpe range | Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| top_q (0.10 – 0.30) | 0.632 – 0.749 | 0.665 (top_q=0.20) |
| costs_bps (5 – 20) | 0.633 – 0.681 | 0.665 (10 bps) |
| regime window (100 – 250d, vs. no filter) | 0.391 – 0.537 | **0.665 (no filter — best of all options)** |

Unlike the pre-fix version of this table, the baseline (no regime filter) is
no longer sitting at a suspicious optimum within its own sweep — adding *any*
regime window makes things worse, monotonically. top_q and cost sensitivity
are both smooth, unremarkable curves around the baseline.

## Key design decisions

**Point-in-time universe**: membership reconstructed backward from Wikipedia's
S&P 500 change log. Prices outside a ticker's membership window are masked to
NaN, preventing survivorship bias.

**Walk-forward evaluation**: model re-fits annually on an expanding training
window. No hyperparameters are tuned on test data — the biggest silent risk in
rolling-window backtests. The rebalance grid is spaced exactly `horizon_days`
trading days apart, so the single most recent pre-cutoff training date has a
label that resolves at approximately the same time as the first test date of
the following year — near-zero embargo at each of the 13 annual boundaries.
That date is now purged from each year's training set (`model.py`,
`walk_forward_predict`). Effect was real but small: Sharpe 0.705 → 0.665,
CAGR 10.57% → 10.0%.

**Ranked training labels**: forward returns are converted to cross-sectional
percentile ranks [0, 1] for model training, giving a stable target distribution
across volatile and quiet markets. Raw log returns are used for backtest P&L.

**No regime/market-timing filter**: tested a 200-day SMA cash overlay; once
built on a correct equal-weight return index it reduced Sharpe in every
configuration (see Decomposition). Not used by default.

**EDGAR fundamentals**: quarterly GAAP data fetched from the public SEC EDGAR
XBRL API (no key required). Filing date used as the availability date, taking
the *earliest* filing that reports each period (a later 10-K's five-year
comparative table can otherwise overwrite the true filing date with a much
later one — this was a real bug, see Phase 6a). The API only returns a filing
*date*, not time-of-day, so same-day after-hours filings aren't pushed to the
next trading day; given the 20-trading-day rebalance grid this has low
practical impact, but it's a known, undodged limitation of the data source.

**Dev mode** (`universe.mode: dev`): restricts each date's universe to the
top-100 tickers by trailing dollar volume, for fast iteration. Its metrics
run meaningfully hotter than full-universe. Tested whether this was
overfitting to that specific liquid subset vs. a general small-sample effect
by rerunning on three genuinely random 100-ticker draws:

| Universe | IC t-stat | Sharpe | CAGR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dev-mode (top-100-by-liquidity) | 0.87 | 0.753 | 13.7% |
| Random-100 (seed=42) | 1.03 | 0.542 | 7.9% |
| Random-100 (seed=123) | 1.57 | 0.564 | 9.6% |
| Random-100 (seed=7) | 0.76 | 0.885 | 14.5% |
| **Full universe (607, honest number)** | **0.48** | **0.665** | **10.0%** |

IC doesn't vanish on random subsets — comparable to or higher than the
liquidity-selected one — which rules out the narrowest overfitting concern
(features/model curve-fit specifically to that original recurring ~100-name
set). But every 100-ticker sample, however chosen, shows noisier IC and a
nearly 2x Sharpe spread (0.54–0.89) purely from which 100 companies happen to
be in the sample. Dev mode was never a stable estimate of anything, for any
100-ticker subset — full mode is the only credible number to report; dev mode
is for fast local iteration only.

## Known limitations (not yet addressed)

- **Feature pruning was in-sample.** Both the original 8→5 trim this session
  and the earlier Phase 4b pruning were decided using IC measured over the
  *same* 2013–2026 span the backtest reports performance over — textbook
  in-sample feature selection. A held-out window for feature decisions would
  fix this; not yet done.

## Survivorship bias handling

1. Change-log completeness trusted only back to `universe.floor_date` (2010-01-01).
2. Ticker renames may appear as spurious remove/add pairs — inspect coverage audit.
3. Some delisted tickers have no retrievable price history (177 empty of 814 tickers).
