Strategy: long top-20% by model score, 20-day rebalance, no market-timing
overlay, 10 bps per-side transaction costs. **No short leg** — the long-short
design was the original intent (isolating the cross-sectional signal by
canceling market beta), but shorting costs and hard-to-borrow constraints on
smaller/delisted names aren't modeled in this backtest's data, so long-only is
the more realistic framing given that limitation, at the cost of not cleanly
separating stock-selection skill from market beta. See **Decomposition**
below for how much of the return is attributable to each.

## Decomposition: how much is the model actually contributing?

A long-only, trend-filtered strategy's Sharpe conflates three things: equity
beta over a strong bull period, any market-timing overlay, and the
cross-sectional model. This breaks it apart:

| Configuration | Sharpe | Ann. return | Vol | Max DD | CAGR |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (a) Equal-weight buy-and-hold, no regime, no model | 0.570 | 9.83% | 17.25% | -37.8% | 8.60% |
| (b) Equal-weight + 200d regime filter, no model | 0.472 | 5.35% | 11.33% | -22.5% | 4.80% |
| **(c) Model portfolio, no regime filter (current default)** | **0.665** | **10.97%** | 16.50% | -31.4% | **10.00%** |
| (d) Model + 200d regime filter | 0.471 | 5.41% | 11.50% | -25.3% | 4.84% |

Two things this shows plainly:

1. **The regime filter hurts, in both cases it's applied** — (a)→(b) and
   (c)→(d) both lose Sharpe. It was originally intended as a risk-reducing
   market-timing overlay; once built on a correct equal-weight *return* index
   (see below), it doesn't earn its keep. It's not used by default.
2. **The model beats passive buy-and-hold on this specific historical sample**
   — (c) beats (a) by both Sharpe and absolute return. Whether that's a real,
   generalizable edge or a good draw from noise is a separate question — see
   **Statistical significance** and **Factor regression** below. The honest
   answer, once you control for known factor exposures rather than just raw
   buy-and-hold, is worse than "not confidently distinguishable from luck" —
   it's a significantly *negative* risk-adjusted alpha.

**A bug this decomposition surfaced**: the original regime filter averaged
raw *price levels* across the universe (`prices.mean(axis=1)`) rather than
compounding daily *returns* — a price-weighted index, not equal-weighted (a
$500 stock moved it 100x more than a $5 stock for the same % move). Fixed in
`equal_weight_index()` (`src/backtest/backtest.py`). Once fixed, the
200-day window — which happened to sit at the top of its own sensitivity
sweep under the old (buggy) index — no longer looks favorable at any window;
see **Sensitivity summary**.

## Factor regression: is this just known factor exposure?

The decomposition above answers "model vs. no model." The industry-standard
version of that question is a factor regression: does the strategy's return
survive controlling for the Fama-French 5 factors (market, size, value,
profitability, investment) plus momentum? Daily factor data from Ken
French's data library, compounded to match each backtest period's exact
date range (`src/backtest/factor_data.py`, `build_factor_regression.py`).

| Factor | Coefficient | t-stat | p-value |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alpha (period) | -0.0044 | **-4.79** | <0.001 |
| Mkt-RF | 1.036 | 42.78 | <0.001 |
| SMB (size) | 0.110 | 2.78 | 0.006 |
| HML (value) | -0.058 | -1.63 | 0.105 |
| RMW (profitability) | 0.187 | 3.96 | <0.001 |
| CMA (investment) | 0.071 | 1.17 | 0.243 |
| MOM (momentum) | 0.083 | 3.03 | 0.003 |

R² = 0.943 (adj. 0.941), n = 168 periods. **Annualized alpha: -5.56%/yr,
strongly significant.**

Exactly the exposures you'd expect given the feature set: near-1.0 market
beta (long-only, always invested), significant profitability tilt (RMW —
this is `roe`/`gross_prof`), significant momentum tilt (MOM — this is
`mom_12_1`), and a smaller size tilt. 94% of the strategy's return variance
is explained by six well-known, freely-investable factors. **The residual
— the part attributable to this specific model's stock selection, beyond
just having those tilts — is significantly *negative***, not merely
insignificant. Checked whether this is a transaction-cost artifact: gross
(pre-cost) alpha is -5.06%/yr (t=-4.35), barely different from the
cost-inclusive -5.56%/yr — this isn't costs, the specific stocks chosen
within the factor tilts underperform what the tilts alone would predict,
even before paying to trade them.

This is the most direct answer yet to "isn't this just momentum beta in ML
clothing?" — yes, and once you control for that, there's no stock-picking
skill left to find.

## Statistical significance: is this distinguishable from luck?

**Momentum-only baseline.** A naive 12-1 month momentum sort (no model, no
fundamentals, no LightGBM) over the identical 169 periods:

| | IC t-stat | Sharpe | CAGR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Momentum-only (single feature) | 0.62 | 0.653 | 9.6% |
| Full model (5 features + LightGBM) | 0.48 | 0.665 | 10.0% |

The entire pipeline — EDGAR fundamentals, feature engineering, walk-forward
LightGBM — earns essentially a rounding error over sorting by trailing
12-month return alone, and has *lower* IC doing it. This is the honest
complexity-vs-payoff comparison an interviewer would run in their head.

**Permutation null test.** Shuffled which ticker gets which predicted score
within each rebalance date (destroying any real score↔outcome relationship
while preserving the cross-sectional and time-series structure), recomputed
IC, repeated 2,000 times to build a null distribution:

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Observed IC mean | +0.0050 |
| Null distribution mean | +0.0001 (centered at ~0, as expected) |
| Null distribution std | 0.0036 |
| **Empirical p-value** (P(null IC ≥ observed)) | **0.089** |
| Observed IC's percentile in the null | 91st |

**This does not clear conventional significance (p < 0.05).** The observed
IC is directionally positive and beats ~91% of random permutations, but a
p-value of 0.089 means we can't confidently rule out that this is a good
draw from noise rather than genuine, generalizable predictive skill.

**Full-strategy permutation null (Sharpe, not just IC).** The IC test above
checks raw ranking accuracy; a separate question is whether the *complete,
cost-inclusive strategy* — top-20% selection, 10bps costs, actual turnover —
beats naive random stock-picking. Ran the exact same portfolio construction
on 1,000 random rankings (shuffled scores, not just shuffled IC pairings):

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Observed Sharpe | 0.665 |
| Null distribution mean | 0.44 |
| Null distribution std | 0.043 |
| **Empirical p-value** (P(null Sharpe ≥ observed)) | **< 0.001** |
| Observed Sharpe's percentile in the null | 100th (beats all 1,000) |

This clears significance decisively — but two things temper what it actually
means. First, the null mean is 0.44, not 0, because even a fully random
75-name long-only S&P 500 portfolio captures real market beta over this bull
market; this tests "beats random stock-picking," not "beats doing nothing."
Second, and more important: **turnover explains a real chunk of this gap,
separate from ranking skill.** The model's picks come from slow-moving
features (12-month momentum, ROE), so month-to-month selections overlap
heavily — 40% turnover vs. ~158% for fully-reshuffled random rankings, a
real cost-drag difference, not a predictive-accuracy difference. So the
honest reconciliation of the two null tests: raw period-by-period ranking
accuracy is marginal (IC p=0.089), but the full strategy's persistence in
its picks (low turnover) gives it a genuine, structural cost advantage over
naive high-turnover random selection (Sharpe p<0.001). Both are true; they
answer different questions, and neither alone is the whole picture.

(This test also caught a real bug in its own construction: an early version
used `.stack(future_stack=True)` without dropping the resulting NaN padding,
silently breaking the top-quintile selection for most permutations and
producing an invalid p=0.007. Caught via a turnover sanity check — the
buggy version showed ~0.05 average turnover for "fully random" rankings,
implausible for genuine reshuffling — fixed, and the corrected run is what's
reported above.)

Combined with the momentum-only comparison and the factor regression above,
the fair summary of this whole project is: **rigorous, correctly-built
infrastructure (point-in-time universe, walk-forward validation, EDGAR
integration) that outperforms naive random stock-picking largely through
known factor exposures (market beta, profitability, momentum) and lower
turnover, not novel stock-selection skill — and once those factors are
controlled for, the residual alpha is significantly negative, not merely
insignificant.** This is a well-built research pipeline that correctly
identifies its own strategy as a repackaging of established factors rather
than a validated edge.

**Feature selection was in-sample — tested whether fixing that changes the
conclusion; it doesn't.** Both the original 8→5 trim and the earlier Phase 4b
pruning used IC measured over the same 2013–2026 span the backtest reports
performance over. To check the impact, re-derived a feature set using
*only* pre-2020 IC (a proper held-out selection window): under the same
threshold rule, only `mom_12_1` and `roe` survive — `dollar_vol_60`, one of
the 5 currently used, actually shows *negative* IC pre-2020 (t=-0.16) despite
being the strongest feature in the 2020-2026 period (t=1.43). Individual
feature IC is that unstable across sub-periods; several features flip sign
entirely (`mom_1`: t=-2.00 pre-2020 → t=+0.90 after; `rsi_14`: t=-1.96 →
t=+0.93).

Compared honestly on the true 2020-2026 holdout (never used to select either
feature set):

| Feature set | Full-period Sharpe / IC t | Holdout-only Sharpe / IC t |
|---|---|---|
| 5-feature (in-sample selected, current default) | 0.665 / 0.48 | 0.477 / **0.18** |
| 2-feature (honestly selected, pre-2020 only) | 0.627 / 0.22 | 0.426 / **-0.54** |

The honestly-selected set doesn't generalize better — it's worse on the true
holdout. Kept the 5-feature set as the default, since switching doesn't
objectively improve anything measurable. The real conclusion isn't "5 vs 2
features" — it's that the underlying signal is too weak for feature selection
to meaningfully discriminate at all, which is the same conclusion the
permutation test already reached from a different angle.

**New feature tested and rejected: insider trading (Form 4).** Built a
point-in-time panel from SEC's bulk quarterly Form 3/4/5 datasets
(`src/data/insider.py`), filtered to genuine open-market purchases/sales only
(`TRANS_CODE` in `{P, S}` — excludes option exercises, tax withholding,
grants, gifts, which carry no signal about an insider's actual view), using
filing date as the point-in-time availability date (Form 4 has a strict
2-business-day filing deadline, a much tighter lag than the fundamentals
issue fixed earlier). Feature: net buy/sell count ratio over a trailing
90-day window.

Validated with the same held-out methodology as the feature-pruning
investigation above, *before* deciding whether to add it:

| Window | insider_score IC t-stat |
|---|---|
| Selection window (pre-2020) | **-0.32** |
| Holdout (2020-2026) | 0.50 |
| Full period | 0.06 |

Doesn't clear the same bar (|t|≥0.5 on the selection window) applied to every
other feature — the selection-window t-stat is negative. **Not added to the
model.** Deliberately didn't try alternate constructions (different window
lengths, dollar-weighting, restricting to officers/directors) after seeing
this result — iterating until some variant clears the bar is exactly the
in-sample selection problem this section exists to avoid. The panel-building
code and cached data remain in the repo if a differently-motivated
construction is worth testing later, decided in advance rather than reverse-
engineered from a result.

## Feature set (5 features, all rank-normalised cross-sectionally)

Started at 8; `mom_3`, `mom_1`, `rsi_14` were excluded from training from the
start (negative individual IC). `mom_6_1`, `high_52w`, `vol_21` were later
dropped after measuring ~zero individual IC — see **Known Limitations** for
why that specific decision has a methodology caveat of its own.

| Feature | Type | IC | t-stat |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mom_12_1` | Price — 12-1 month momentum | +0.012 | 0.85 |
| `dollar_vol_60` | Price — 60-day avg dollar volume | +0.006 | 0.85 |
| `gross_prof` | Fundamental — gross profit / assets (Novy-Marx) | +0.002 | 0.21 |
| `roe` | Fundamental — net income / equity | +0.011 | 1.34 |
| `ep_ratio` | Fundamental — earnings / market cap | -0.004 | -0.44 |

None of these individually clears a conventional significance bar, and with
5+ features tested, `roe`'s t=1.34 shouldn't be read as a standout finding —
it's what you'd expect to see somewhere in this set by chance alone. The
model's IC (t=0.48, combining all features nonlinearly via LightGBM) is the
number that actually matters, and it's modest.

## Sensitivity summary

| Dimension | Sharpe range | Baseline |
|---|---|---|
| top_q (0.10 – 0.30) | 0.632 – 0.749 | 0.665 (top_q=0.20) |
| costs_bps (5 – 20) | 0.633 – 0.681 | 0.665 (10 bps) |
| regime window (100 – 250d, vs. no filter) | 0.391 – 0.537 | **0.665 (no filter — best of all options)** |

Unlike the pre-fix version of this table, the baseline (no regime filter) is
no longer sitting at a suspicious optimum within its own sweep — adding *any*
regime window makes things worse, monotonically. top_q and cost sensitivity
are both smooth, unremarkable curves around the baseline.

## Key design decisions

**Point-in-time universe**: membership reconstructed backward from Wikipedia's
S&P 500 change log. Prices outside a ticker's membership window are masked to
NaN, preventing survivorship bias.

**Walk-forward evaluation**: model re-fits annually on an expanding training
window. No hyperparameters are tuned on test data — the biggest silent risk in
rolling-window backtests. The rebalance grid is spaced exactly `horizon_days`
trading days apart, so the single most recent pre-cutoff training date has a
label that resolves at approximately the same time as the first test date of
the following year — near-zero embargo at each of the 13 annual boundaries.
That date is now purged from each year's training set (`model.py`,
`walk_forward_predict`). Effect was real but small: Sharpe 0.705 → 0.665,
CAGR 10.57% → 10.0%.

**Ranked training labels**: forward returns are converted to cross-sectional
percentile ranks [0, 1] for model training, giving a stable target distribution
across volatile and quiet markets. Raw log returns are used for backtest P&L.

**No regime/market-timing filter**: tested a 200-day SMA cash overlay; once
built on a correct equal-weight return index it reduced Sharpe in every
configuration (see Decomposition). Not used by default.

**EDGAR fundamentals**: quarterly GAAP data fetched from the public SEC EDGAR
XBRL API (no key required). Filing date used as the availability date, taking
the *earliest* filing that reports each period (a later 10-K's five-year
comparative table can otherwise overwrite the true filing date with a much
later one — this was a real bug, see Phase 6a). The API only returns a filing
*date*, not time-of-day, so same-day after-hours filings aren't pushed to the
next trading day; given the 20-trading-day rebalance grid this has low
practical impact, but it's a known, undodged limitation of the data source.

**Dev mode** (`universe.mode: dev`): restricts each date's universe to the
top-100 tickers by trailing dollar volume, for fast iteration. Its metrics
run meaningfully hotter than full-universe. Tested whether this was
overfitting to that specific liquid subset vs. a general small-sample effect
by rerunning on three genuinely random 100-ticker draws:

| Universe | IC t-stat | Sharpe | CAGR |
|---|---|---|---|
| Dev-mode (top-100-by-liquidity) | 0.87 | 0.753 | 13.7% |
| Random-100 (seed=42) | 1.03 | 0.542 | 7.9% |
| Random-100 (seed=123) | 1.57 | 0.564 | 9.6% |
| Random-100 (seed=7) | 0.76 | 0.885 | 14.5% |
| **Full universe (607, honest number)** | **0.48** | **0.665** | **10.0%** |

IC doesn't vanish on random subsets — comparable to or higher than the
liquidity-selected one — which rules out the narrowest overfitting concern
(features/model curve-fit specifically to that original recurring ~100-name
set). But every 100-ticker sample, however chosen, shows noisier IC and a
nearly 2x Sharpe spread (0.54–0.89) purely from which 100 companies happen to
be in the sample. Dev mode was never a stable estimate of anything, for any
100-ticker subset — full mode is the only credible number to report; dev mode
is for fast local iteration only.

## Survivorship bias handling

1. Change-log completeness trusted only back to `universe.floor_date` (2010-01-01).
2. Ticker renames may appear as spurious remove/add pairs — inspect coverage audit.
3. Some delisted tickers have no retrievable price history (177 empty of 814 tickers).
